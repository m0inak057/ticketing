## Important Notes for CSV Preparation

1. **No Text Limitations**: Include as much detail as needed in description fields. There are no character limits for text fields such as event descriptions, terms, etc.

2. **Date and Time Format**: Be precise with date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (24-hour HH:MM) formats. Incorrect formats will cause processing errors.

3. **CSV Formatting**: 
   - Ensure commas within text fields are properly handled (most spreadsheet programs do this automatically when saving as CSV)
   - If your text contains commas, ensure the text is enclosed in double quotes when saving as CSV
   - Do not add extra spaces before or after commas

4. **File Processing**:
   - Currently, only the first row (after headers) will be processed as an event
   - For multiple events, please prepare and submit separate CSV files
   - The system will attempt to process files with minor issues but may return error messages

5. **Multi-Day Events**: For events spanning multiple days, provide both start and end dates/times.

6. **Pricing**: Enter all prices as decimal numbers without currency symbols (e.g., 25.00, not $25).

7. **Special Characters**: Most special characters are supported in text fields, but avoid using HTML tags or script elements.

8. **Image References**: If referencing image URLs, ensure they are publicly accessible.

## File Submission

After completing your CSV file:
1. Save it with a descriptive name (e.g., "SummerFestival2025.csv")
2. Upload it using the CSV upload option on the event creation page
3. Review any system messages after upload
4. Check the created event in draft mode before publishing
