# Cashfree Webhook Integration Fix - Summary

## Problem
The previous implementation was looking for a separate "webhook secret key" that Cashfree doesn't provide. This was causing webhook signature verification to fail with 401 Unauthorized errors.

## Solution
Updated the implementation to use the API Secret (Client Secret) for webhook verification, which is the correct approach according to Cashfree's documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Settings Configuration
**File**: `tapnex_ticketing_system/settings.py`
- Removed `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` configuration
- Updated comments to clarify that `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` is used for both API calls and webhook verification

### 2. Updated Webhook Verification Function
**File**: `ticketing/views.py`
- Modified `verify_cashfree_signature()` function to use `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` instead of `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`
- Updated error messages and logging
- Added better documentation explaining the Cashfree verification process

### 3. Updated Initialization Checks
**File**: `ticketing/views.py`
- Removed validation check for non-existent `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`
- Updated logging to reflect that `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` handles both API calls and webhook verification

### 4. Updated Environment File
**File**: `.env`
- Removed placeholder for `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`
- Simplified to only include the necessary Cashfree configuration variables

### 5. Updated Diagnostic Script
**File**: `fix_webhook_secret.py`
- Updated to check for `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` instead of separate webhook secret
- Fixed instructions to guide users to use their API Secret
- Updated error messages and explanations

### 6. Updated Configuration Checker
**File**: `check_cashfree_config.py`
- Removed check for non-existent webhook secret
- Added note about using Client Secret for both purposes

### 7. Created New Test Script
**File**: `test_cashfree_webhook_verification.py` (NEW)
- Comprehensive test script for webhook signature verification
- Demonstrates correct implementation with examples
- Tests both valid and invalid signatures

### 8. Created Implementation Guide
**File**: `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (NEW)
- Complete documentation of the correct implementation
- Examples and troubleshooting guide
- Migration instructions for existing implementations

## Key Points for Users

1. **No Separate Webhook Secret**: Cashfree uses the API Secret (Client Secret) for webhook verification
2. **Configuration**: Only need `CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID` and `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` in environment variables
3. **Signature Format**: HMAC SHA-256 of (timestamp + payload) using API Secret, base64 encoded
4. **Headers**: Extract `x-webhook-signature` and `x-webhook-timestamp` from webhook requests

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Signature generation matches expected format
- ✅ Valid signatures are accepted
- ✅ Invalid signatures are rejected
- ✅ Django system check passes
- ✅ No syntax errors in updated files

## Impact

This fix will resolve the webhook 401 Unauthorized errors and allow proper processing of Cashfree payment notifications, ensuring that payment status updates are correctly reflected in the application.

## Files to Update in Production

When deploying this fix, ensure these files are updated:
1. `tapnex_ticketing_system/settings.py`
2. `ticketing/views.py`
3. `.env` (remove `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` if present)

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:
1. Run `python test_cashfree_webhook_verification.py` to verify implementation
2. Monitor webhook logs for successful verification
3. Test a payment flow to ensure webhooks are processed correctly
