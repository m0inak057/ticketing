# 🚀 Static Files Deployment Fix

## Problem
Images, logos, and sounds not displaying on deployed website.

## Quick Fix

1. **Run the updated build script:**
```bash
./build_files.sh
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

3. **Test static files:**
Visit: `https://your-domain.com/test-static/`

## What Was Fixed

✅ Updated Django settings for Vercel compatibility
✅ Added static file serving in production
✅ Enhanced build script with verification
✅ Created debug page at `/test-static/`

## Test Your Fix

Visit `/test-static/` on your deployed site to see:
- ✅/❌ Status for each static file
- File sizes and paths
- Environment configuration

## If Still Not Working

1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Visit `/test-static/` for detailed diagnostics
3. Verify files exist in `staticfiles_build/` directory
