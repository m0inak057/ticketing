# Cashfree Webhook Setup & Verification

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Webhook Endpoint
- **URL**: `/cashfree-webhook/`
- **Method**: POST
- **CSRF Exempt**: Yes (required for webhooks)

### 2. Signature Verification
- **Function**: `verify_cashfree_signature(payload, signature, timestamp)`
- **Algorithm**: HMAC SHA-256
- **Process**: 
  1. Concatenate `timestamp + rawBody`
  2. Compute HMAC SHA-256 using your Secret Key
  3. Base-64 encode the result
  4. Compare with signature header

### 3. Webhook Handler
- **Function**: `cashfree_webhook(request)`
- **Features**:
  - ‚úÖ Signature verification
  - ‚úÖ Payment status processing
  - ‚úÖ Automatic ticket creation
  - ‚úÖ Duplicate processing prevention
  - ‚úÖ Error logging
  - ‚úÖ Proper HTTP responses

### 4. Configuration
- **Settings**: Added `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` to settings.py
- **Environment**: Uses same value as `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Credentials**: App ID and Secret Key from Cashfree dashboard

## üîß How It Works

### Webhook Flow
1. **Cashfree sends webhook** ‚Üí Your server receives POST request
2. **Extract headers** ‚Üí `x-webhook-signature` and `x-webhook-timestamp`
3. **Verify signature** ‚Üí Using your Secret Key
4. **Process payment** ‚Üí Update transaction status
5. **Create tickets** ‚Üí If payment successful
6. **Send response** ‚Üí 200 OK to acknowledge receipt

### Payment Statuses Handled
- ‚úÖ `SUCCESS` ‚Üí Mark as paid, create tickets
- ‚ùå `FAILED` ‚Üí Mark as failed
- ‚ùå `USER_DROPPED` ‚Üí Mark as failed  
- ‚ùå `CANCELLED` ‚Üí Mark as failed

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Configure Webhook URL in Cashfree Dashboard
```
Webhook URL: https://yourdomain.com/cashfree-webhook/
```

### 2. Test with Real Payments
- Make a test payment through your application
- Check logs for webhook processing
- Verify tickets are created automatically

### 3. Monitor Logs
- Check Django logs for webhook processing
- Look for signature verification messages
- Monitor ticket creation success/failure

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Signature verification fails**
   - Check if `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` is set correctly
   - Verify the Secret Key matches your Cashfree dashboard

2. **Webhook not received**
   - Ensure URL is publicly accessible
   - Check if CSRF exemption is working
   - Verify Cashfree webhook URL configuration

3. **Tickets not created**
   - Check if `PaymentTransaction` exists with correct `order_id`
   - Verify event capacity is available
   - Check logs for specific error messages

### Log Messages to Watch
- `"Webhook signature verification failed: Missing signature or timestamp"`
- `"Error creating tickets for transaction {order_id}: {error}"`
- `"Error processing webhook for order {order_id}: {error}"`
