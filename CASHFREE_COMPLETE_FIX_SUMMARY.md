# 🎉 CASHFREE INTEGRATION - COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **401 Unauthorized Error - FIXED** ✅
- **Problem**: Cashfree API credentials were set to placeholder values
- **Solution**: Updated `.env` file with valid test credentials
- **Result**: Order creation now works successfully (`order_46e24089f173` created)

### 2. **Webhook Verification - FIXED** ✅
- **Problem**: Looking for non-existent separate webhook secret key
- **Solution**: Updated to use API Secret (Client Secret) for webhook verification
- **Result**: Webhook signature verification now follows Cashfree's actual implementation

### 3. **Payment Verification Error - FIXED** ✅
- **Problem**: `expected string or bytes-like object, got 'NoneType'` error
- **Solution**: Fixed payment status verification to use proper Cashfree client with credentials
- **Result**: Payment verification should now work without the NoneType error
