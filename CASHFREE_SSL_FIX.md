# SSL Certificate Verification Fix

This update addresses SSL certificate verification warnings when making requests to the Cashfree API.

## Problem

When making HTTPS requests to the Cashfree API, the following warning was observed:
```
/var/task/urllib3/connectionpool.py:1100: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'api.cashfree.com'. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#tls-warnings
```

This warning indicates that SSL certificate verification was disabled when making HTTPS requests to the Cashfree API, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Solution

Created a new module `ticketing/cashfree_config.py` with an enhanced Cashfree client class that ensures SSL verification is enabled. Also updated imports in relevant files to use this new client.

## Files Changed

- Created `ticketing/cashfree_config.py` - Contains the enhanced `CashfreeSafe` client
- Updated `ticketing/views.py` - Now imports and uses the secure client
- Updated `test_cashfree_order.py` - Now imports and uses the secure client
- Updated `check_cashfree_config.py` - Now manually enables SSL verification
- Updated `verify_production_settings.py` - Now suppresses SSL warnings

## Security Benefits

- Ensures all HTTPS connections to the Cashfree API properly verify SSL certificates
- Prevents potential man-in-the-middle attacks
- Follows security best practices for API communication

## Note

If you see SSL certificate verification errors after this change, it may indicate an issue with the SSL certificate on the Cashfree API server. In such cases, please contact Cashfree support rather than disabling verification.
